On the algorithm's complexity and scalability.

> The function comprises of two parameters and makes two recursive calls. 
Therefore, the complexity of the algorithm is O(n^2), which means it is not scalable as the function 2^n grows exponentially. 
Thus, at large numbers this method takes longer time.
